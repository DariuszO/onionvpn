ponyVPN
=======

PonyVPN is a thought experiment... and it isn't really meant to be used.

Originally the idea was to create various types of obfuscated VPN transports...
That is, when surveilling the network the VPN traffic may look like a bi-directional
syn or icmp flood etc.

As it turns out... learning how to mangle packets, disect packet etcetera is very useful
for other things such as network surveillance, performing various types of traceroute...
